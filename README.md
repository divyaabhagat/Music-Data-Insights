**Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing a Spotify dataset that includes various attributes related to tracks, albums, and artists using SQL. 
It encompasses the entire process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, executing SQL queries of different complexities, and optimizing query performance. 
The main objectives are to enhance advanced SQL skills and extract valuable insights from the dataset.

**Project Steps**
**Data Exploration**

Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s crucial to thoroughly understand the dataset. Key attributes include:
Artist: The performer of the track.
Track: The name of the song.
Album: The album to which the track belongs.
Album Type: The type of album (e.g., single or full album).
Various Metrics: Includes attributes like danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and more.

**Querying the Data**
Once the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be executed to explore and analyze the information. Queries are categorized into three levels to help develop SQL skills progressively:
Easy Queries: Focus on simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.
Medium Queries: Involve more complex operations such as grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.
Advanced Queries: Feature nested subqueries, window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and performance optimization techniques.

**Query Optimization**
In the advanced stages, the emphasis shifts to enhancing query performance. Key optimization strategies include:
Indexing: Implementing indexes on frequently queried columns to speed up data retrieval.

### Technology Stack
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **SQL Queries**: DDL, DML, Aggregations, Joins, Subqueries, Window Functions  
- **Tools**: MySQL Workbench, PostgreSQL (via Homebrew, Docker, or direct installation)  

### How to Run the Project
1. **Install MySQL**  
2. **Set Up the Database**: Use the provided normalization structure to create the database schema and tables.  
3. **Insert Sample Data**: Populate the tables with the sample data.  
4. **Execute SQL Queries**: Solve the specified problems using SQL queries.  
5. **Explore Optimization Techniques**: Investigate query optimization methods for handling large datasets.  

### Next Steps
- **Visualize the Data**: Utilize a data visualization tool like Tableau or Power BI to create dashboards based on your query results.  
- **Expand Dataset**: Increase the number of rows in the dataset for more comprehensive analysis and scalability testing.  
- **Advanced Querying**: Further explore query optimization and assess the performance of SQL queries on larger datasets.
